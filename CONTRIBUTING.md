Contributing to devtools-snippets
=================================

Thanks for your interest in contributing to devtools-snippets!

If you'd like to **add a new snippet**: Take a look at an existing snippet: https://github.com/bgrins/devtools-snippets/tree/master/snippets/jquerify.  You can copy this format into /snippets/your-snippet/ with the README.md documenting and linking to your screenshot.  The README will be copied into the home page at http://bgrins.github.io/devtools-snippets/

If you'd like to **modify an existing snippet**: Feel free to make improvements to an existing snippet.  Do not worry about rebuilding index.html, just make sure the README looks good and I will rebuild the site before pushing up changes.

If you'd like to **modify the HTML**: Be sure to change template.html, not index.html (it is autogenerated).  By running `./build.js`, you can preview changes. No need to include the autogenerated file in a pull request, I will rebuild it before pushing up changes.
